Scope
This is a project for the Natural Language Processing Course taught in the graduate programm of the Computer Science department of the Univerisity of Texas at Dallas during the fall semester 2016.

Goal
The objective of this project is to apply various sentiment analysis techniques(NLP) on the restaurant reviews and assess if they can correctly identify the tone of the reviews as positive/negative/neutral.

Data
Yelp has publicly released a sample of their data (including over 2.7 million reviews) as part of their Dataset Challenge. This data can be used for the project as it is easy/quick to acquire. This solution uses the data sets provided by Yelp in the Yelp Dataset Challenge. It is available online at Yelp dataset, located at [1]

It includes the data

7M reviews and 649K tips by 687K users for 86K businesses
566K business attributes, e.g., hours, parking availability, ambience.
Social network of 687K users for a total of 4.2M social edges.
Aggregated check-ins over time for each of the 86K businesses
200,000 pictures from the included businesses
The data for the project was taken from following two files

yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
Tools and Technologies used
Python, NLTK

Proposed Solution

Defining Sentiment

For the purpose of project, we define sentiment to be "a personal positive or negative feeling." Here are some examples:

Sentiment	Review
Positive	The food here is very good.
Neutral	The ambience is okay and the food was usual.
Negative	I am never coming to this restaurant again. The food was tasteless.
High Level Steps

The high-level sequence involved in processing is as follows:

Raw data collection from Yelp Dataset

Sentiment labeling

Transform into train/test sets for classifier

Bag of Words

Transform train/test sets for final classification by classifier

Adjust classifier and repeat until best model

Dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code.

NLTK
Pandas
Also you must have installed the stopword corpora of NLTK. Run the following in a python console for NTLK downloader.

import nltk

nltk.download()

Extracting reviews
This step must be done before running any of the classifiers below.

You need to run the DataCreator file to extract the reviews for businesses of category restaurant and generate samples for each review class (pos/neg/neutral). The script creates three json files one for each class and a file which contains all the restaurant id and names.

python data_Creator.py

(Make sure to have input data files in folder yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset . For created sample files check yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset folder)
